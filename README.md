# idolminds

Speak with your idols. IdolMinds is meant to be a conversational AI that _sounds_ and _speaks_ like your heroes, using fine-tuned voice and language models. First iteration will be aiming to support [Alan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts).

IdolMinds is built using Modal and FastAPI for deployment, [coqui-ai/TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) for text-to-speech, and OpenAI language models for text generation.
